# 🏥 Multiple Disease Prediction System

Welcome to the **Multiple Disease Prediction System** – a machine learning-powered web app designed to predict the likelihood of several diseases based on user health inputs. It's a helpful diagnostic aid for early detection and awareness.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Predict Multiple Diseases** – Trained ML models for Diabetes, Heart Disease, and more.
- 📊 **Interactive UI** – Input patient data through a clean form interface.
- 📈 **Accurate ML Models** – Uses real-world datasets for predictions.
- 🌐 **Web-Based App** – Built using Python and Streamlit for accessibility.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend/ML:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Deployment:** Localhost / Streamlit Cloud
